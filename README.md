## Overview

- This homepage was already amazing as it is (big ups to whoever designed the pageðŸ’œ), i just decided to add my own touch to it, cause why notðŸ˜„. Shout to the team at [Buycoins Africa](https://twitter.com/buycoins).

## My process

- I took my time in doing building this website, i didn't want to rush it. Started off with designing for mobile view as usual, then i worked all the way up to larger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex System
- jQuery
- Bootsrap
- AOS animations

### What I learned

I learnt a whole bunch of new stuffs while working on this. Implented some new HTML tags which i learnt about, especially the figure, picture and source tag which i never really understood or used before til now

```html
<figure>
  <picture>
    <source />
  </picture>
</figure>
```

This line enough of code saved me from deleting the whole project and starting from scratchðŸ˜…. Thanks to [@Ibimina](https://twitter.com/IbiminaaH?s=20&t=fxU9Xdm5C5J5tFqcFMvhgg)

```css
overflow-x: hidden;
```

### Useful resources

- [For the slide-in-animations with AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - I find this to be really helpful in achieving the sleek animations i pulled off on this site
